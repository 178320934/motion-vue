title: LayoutGroup
---

like `LayoutGroup` in `framer-motion`, the `LayoutGroup` will detect the layout changes of its children and apply the layout animations.

>note: unlike `React`, in `Vue`, when parent updates, the children will not be re-rendered. unless child dependence has changed. so it need manual trigger children update.
