`useAnimationControls` provides an imperative way to control animations, allowing you to precisely control when animations start, stop and reset through code.

`useAnimationControls` returns an animation controller with `start`, `stop`, `set` methods.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useAnimationControls } from 'motion-v'

const controls = useAnimationControls()
</script>
```

The returned animation controller can be passed to a motion component's `animate` prop to control its animations:

```vue
<Motion :animate="controls" />
```

## Basic Usage

<ComponentPreview name="pan" />

## Methods

### start

Starts an animation with a transition effect. Takes a target state and optional transition config:

```ts
controls.start({ x: 100 })
```

### stop

Stops an animation.

```ts
controls.stop()
```

### set

Sets the animation to a target state without a transition effect.

```ts
controls.set({ x: 100 })
```
